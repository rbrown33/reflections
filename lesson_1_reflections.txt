git clone

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

git log - provide history of file
git --no-pager log --reverse --decorate=short --pretty=oneline

git diff

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- Automatic systems help prevent data loss in case of a computer failure
- Manually keeps the repo smaller and more organized

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- software tends to have multiple files that work together, so files are often dependent on one another.
- Text documents usually do not depend on other text documents, so committing  single file often makes sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- git log shows a descriptive message for each commit and git diff shows what changed between two commits

git checkout id_hash - reset all files to the specified commit version in the repository. backout changes
git checkout - checkout most recent head version
git checkout -- file1 file2 - revert specified files

git init

git status
