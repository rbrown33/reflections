When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The Github version might get corrupted and this corrupted version would be pushed to everyone's local copy which is nasogud.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- fork copies one Github repo directly to another Github repo. This gives cred to the original creatr
- clone copies a repo from Github to local so it can be worked on
- branch allows dev to happen without messin up mainline
